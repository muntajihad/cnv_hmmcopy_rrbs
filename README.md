# CNV estimation from DNA methylation sequencing data (RRBS)

This tutorial is based on [HMMcopy R package vignette](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/HMMcopy.html)

**used tools:** HMMcopy (R package)
**used files:** aligned reads (BAM file)
                reference genome
           
           
**HMMCopy R package is designed to estimate copy number variation (CNV) from whole genome sequencing data (WGS). But, here I will use it to estimate CNV from Reduced Representative Bisulfite seqencing data -DNA Methylation-.
