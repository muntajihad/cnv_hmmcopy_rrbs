# CNV estimation from DNA methylation sequencing data (RRBS)

This tutorial is based on [HMMcopy R package vignette](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/HMMcopy.html)

**Used tools:**
> HMMcopy (R package)

**Used files:** 
> aligned reads (BAM file)

> reference genome (hg 19)
 
> wgEncodeCrgMapabilityAlign100mer.bigWig downloaded from [UCSC.Goldenpath](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/encodeDCC/wgEncodeMapability/)
           
           
#### HMMCopy R package is designed to estimate copy number variation (CNV) from whole genome sequencing data (WGS). But, here I will use it to estimate CNV from Reduced Representative Bisulfite seqencing data -DNA Methylation-.
